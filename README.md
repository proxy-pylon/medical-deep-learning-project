Guys you need to install the dataset from
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kmader/skin-cancer-mnist-ham10000

Then unarchive it. There will be two folders with images. Combine them into one. Btw, each of the two folders may have duplicate images. Don't worry, just ignore duplicates when unarchiving. When you combine them, there will be no duplicates
